# Task: Design Minimalistic Devcontainer Configuration as Fallback Solution

## Objective
Design a comprehensive yet minimalistic devcontainer configuration that serves as a reliable fallback when devenv fails (particularly due to SSH issues), while maintaining consistency with the existing Nix-centric development approach.

## Target/Scope
- `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` - Main container configuration
- `.devcontainer/Dockerfile` - Container image definition with Nix integration
- `.devcontainer/scripts/` - Certificate handling and validation scripts
- Documentation explaining WSL-specific optimizations and migration guidance

## Context & Approach
- Leverage existing NixOS WSL configuration patterns for consistency
- Focus on resilience for corporate environments with Zscaler certificate challenges
- Implement robust SSH forwarding using VS Code/Docker's built-in capabilities
- Minimize repository footprint while providing comprehensive functionality

## Repository-Specific Findings
- Current devcontainer setup exists but is marked as DEPRECATED in favor of devenv
- Existing system/certificates.nix provides sophisticated certificate management patterns
- devenv.nix demonstrates preferred development environment configuration
- Repository uses fish shell as default with starship prompt
- Certificate handling is critical for corporate Zscaler environments
- SSH forwarding complexity is a key pain point requiring robust solution

## Technical Specifications
- Base Image: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS for stability and corporate compatibility
- Nix Package Manager: Single-user mode with flakes and experimental features
- Shell Configuration: Fish as default user shell with starship prompt
- Certificate Management: Multi-layered approach copying WSL host certificates
- SSH Integration: VS Code's native SSH agent forwarding capabilities
- Environment Variables: Comprehensive SSL certificate environment setup
- Validation: Nix-based testing scripts for functionality verification

## Progress Notes
- Analyzed existing devcontainer configuration and identified deprecation reasons
- Reviewed devenv.nix to understand preferred development patterns
- Examined certificate handling in system/certificates.nix for consistency
- Researched VS Code SSH forwarding best practices for WSL environments
- Discovered comprehensive windows-wsl-manager integration in home/windows/ modules
- Identified sophisticated environment variable promotion and certificate handling patterns
- Found existing SSH key sharing mechanisms between WSL and Windows
- Planning comprehensive redesign with focus on reliability and corporate environment support
