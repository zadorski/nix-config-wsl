## Technical Implementation

### XDG Environment Variables

```nix
# Complete XDG Base Directory Specification implementation
XDG_CONFIG_HOME = "${config.home.homeDirectory}/.config";
XDG_DATA_HOME = "${config.home.homeDirectory}/.local/share";
XDG_STATE_HOME = "${config.home.homeDirectory}/.local/state";
XDG_CACHE_HOME = "${config.home.homeDirectory}/.cache";
XDG_RUNTIME_DIR = "/run/user/${toString config.users.users.${userName}.uid}";
```

### WSL2-Specific Considerations

- **Filesystem Compatibility**: Ensured all XDG paths work with WSL2 filesystem
- **Windows Integration**: Maintained compatibility with Windows path resolution
- **Performance**: Optimized for WSL2 I/O characteristics
- **Security**: Proper permissions for XDG_RUNTIME_DIR

### Tool-Specific Configurations

**Git (Native XDG Support):**
```nix
programs.git = {
  # Uses XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config automatically
  # Additional files: ignore, attributes, credentials
};
```

**Shell Tools:**
```nix
programs.fish.enable = true;  # Native XDG support
programs.starship.enable = true;  # Native XDG support
```

**System Monitors:**
```nix
programs.btop.enable = true;  # Uses XDG_CONFIG_HOME/btop/
programs.htop.enable = true;  # Uses XDG_CONFIG_HOME/htop/
```

## Validation and Testing

### Compliance Verification

- [x] All XDG environment variables properly set
- [x] Configuration files placed in correct XDG directories
- [x] Cache files isolated to XDG_CACHE_HOME
