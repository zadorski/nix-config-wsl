# How to use these files with an AI:
# 1. Start by directing the AI to the `AI_ROOT_GUIDE.md` at the project root.
# 2. For specific tasks, refer the AI to relevant files within the .ai directory,
#    e.g., "Follow coding standards in .ai/instructions/coding_standards.md".
# 3. This manifest can be used by wrapper scripts or tools to provide context to AI models.
