# this manifest outlines the structure and purpose of AI-related files and directories
# within this repository. It serves as a guide for both humans and AI agents
# interacting with the project's AI-specific resources

version: "1.0"

# root guide for AI interaction, located in the project's root directory
# this file should be the primary entry point for an AI agent
root_guide: "AI_ROOT_GUIDE.md" # Primary entry point for AI agents

# definition of the .ai directory structure
# all paths are relative to the .ai directory itself, unless specified as project root

# How to use these files with an AI:
# 1. Start by directing the AI to the `AI_ROOT_GUIDE.md` at the project root.
# 2. For specific tasks, refer the AI to relevant files within the .ai directory,
#    e.g., "Follow coding standards in .ai/rules/coding-standards.md".
# 3. This manifest can be used by wrapper scripts or tools to provide context to AI models.
