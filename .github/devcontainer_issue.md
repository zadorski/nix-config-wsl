# Add AGENTS instructions and devcontainer

This issue tracks the addition of an `AGENTS.md` file and a VS Code devcontainer configuration.

- [ ] Provide guidelines for automated contributors in `AGENTS.md`.
- [ ] Add `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` and Dockerfile for reproducible development.
- [ ] Ensure tests (`nix flake check`) and formatting (`nix fmt`) are documented for code changes.

Nix configuration changes are out of scope for this issue.
