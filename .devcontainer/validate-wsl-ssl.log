🔍 WSL SSL Certificate Environment Analysis
==========================================

1. Checking SSL Environment Variables in WSL...
   ✅ SSL_CERT_FILE = /nix/store/sj7dmc12f7mgc61x61yscm9d535lpmr9-nss-cacert-3.108/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt
      📁 File exists (9074 lines)
   ✅ REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE = /nix/store/sj7dmc12f7mgc61x61yscm9d535lpmr9-nss-cacert-3.108/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt
      📁 File exists (9074 lines)
   ✅ CURL_CA_BUNDLE = /nix/store/sj7dmc12f7mgc61x61yscm9d535lpmr9-nss-cacert-3.108/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt
      📁 File exists (9074 lines)
   ✅ NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS = /nix/store/sj7dmc12f7mgc61x61yscm9d535lpmr9-nss-cacert-3.108/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt
      📁 File exists (9074 lines)
   ✅ NIX_SSL_CERT_FILE = /nix/store/sj7dmc12f7mgc61x61yscm9d535lpmr9-nss-cacert-3.108/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt
      📁 File exists (9074 lines)
   ❌ HTTPS_CA_BUNDLE = NOT SET
   ❌ CA_BUNDLE = NOT SET

2. Checking Windows Certificate Propagation...
   ❌ Not found: /mnt/c/zscaler-root-ca.crt
   ❌ Not found: /mnt/c/Program Files/Zscaler/ZSClient/cert.pem
   ❌ Not found: /mnt/c/Program Files (x86)/Zscaler/ZSClient/cert.pem
   ❌ Not found: /mnt/c/Users/nixos/AppData/Roaming/zscaler/cert.pem
   ❌ Not found: /mnt/c/Users/nixos/AppData/Local/zscaler/cert.pem

3. Checking WSL Certificate Locations...
   ✅ File exists: /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt (9138 lines)
   ✅ File exists: /etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt (9138 lines)
   ❌ Not found: /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
   ❌ Not found: /etc/ca-certificates.conf

4. Testing SSL Connectivity from WSL...
   Testing https://nixos.org...
      ❌ curl: FAILED
      ❌ wget: FAILED
   Testing https://github.com...
      ❌ curl: FAILED
      ❌ wget: FAILED
   Testing https://cache.nixos.org...
      ❌ curl: FAILED
      ❌ wget: FAILED

5. Testing APT SSL Configuration...
   ❌ APT cannot connect to repositories

📋 WSL RECOMMENDATIONS:
======================

🔧 Missing Environment Variables in WSL:
   - HTTPS_CA_BUNDLE
   - CA_BUNDLE

⚠️  No Windows certificate files accessible from WSL
   1. Ensure certificate file exists on Windows
   2. Check Windows drive mounting in WSL
   3. Copy certificate to WSL filesystem

🚀 Next Steps for WSL:
1. Set environment variables in WSL
2. Source the updated profile: source ~/.bashrc
3. Test SSL connectivity again
4. Proceed to container validation
