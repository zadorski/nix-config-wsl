# Devcontainer Implementation Summary

## Overview

This directory contains a comprehensive devcontainer configuration designed as a **reliable fallback solution** for the nix-config-wsl repository's development environment. While the primary recommendation is to use `devenv` for development, this devcontainer provides a robust alternative for situations where devenv encounters issues, particularly in corporate environments.

## When to Use This Devcontainer

### ✅ Use Devcontainer When:
- SSH agent forwarding is unreliable or blocked by corporate policies
- Certificate validation issues with Zscaler or corporate proxies
- Team requires identical development environments across different machines
- CI/CD integration needs container-based consistency
- Host environment has complex configuration issues

### ✅ Use Devenv When:
- Standard WSL environment works reliably
- Performance is critical (native vs container overhead)
- Quick environment activation is needed (5-15s vs 2-5min)
- Host integration is preferred over isolation

## Key Features

### 🔐 Corporate Environment Support
- **Multi-source certificate detection**: Repository, WSL host, Windows certificate store
- **Zscaler integration**: Automatic detection and installation of corporate certificates
- **Proxy-friendly configuration**: Designed for corporate network environments
- **Windows-WSL integration**: Leverages repository's windows-wsl-manager patterns

### 🔧 Robust Development Environment
- **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS**: Latest stable base with security updates
- **Nix Package Manager**: Single-user mode with flakes support
- **Fish Shell + Starship**: Consistent with repository shell configuration
- **Development Tools**: Matches `devenv.nix` package selection

### 🧪 Comprehensive Testing
- **Environment validation**: Nix-based testing framework
- **Application testing**: Tests functionality via nix-shell even for non-installed packages
- **Health monitoring**: Docker health checks and startup validation
- **Troubleshooting tools**: Automated diagnostics and fixes

### 🔗 SSH Integration
- **Primary**: VS Code native SSH agent forwarding
- **Fallback**: SSH key mounting with proper permissions
- **Emergency**: SSH key synchronization using repository patterns

## Quick Start

### Option 1: VS Code Integration
1. Open repository in VS Code
2. When prompted, choose "Reopen in Container"
3. Wait for automatic setup (2-5 minutes first time)
4. Run validation: `~/.devcontainer-scripts/validate-environment.sh`

### Option 2: Manual Setup
```bash
# Build and run container
docker build -t nix-wsl-dev .devcontainer
docker run -it --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/workspaces/nix-config-wsl nix-wsl-dev

# Inside container, run setup
~/.devcontainer-scripts/setup-environment.sh
```

## Performance Comparison

| Metric | Devenv | Devcontainer | Notes |
|--------|--------|--------------|-------|
| Startup Time | 5-15s | 2-5min | Container overhead |
| Memory Usage | ~50MB | ~500MB | Container isolation |
| File I/O | Native | ~90% native | Bind mount performance |
| Reliability | Host-dependent | Consistent | Container isolation benefits |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### SSH Agent Not Working
```bash
# Check SSH agent status
echo $SSH_AUTH_SOCK
ssh-add -l

# Test connectivity
ssh -T git@github.com

# Run diagnostics
~/.devcontainer-scripts/troubleshoot.sh
```

#### Certificate Issues
```bash
# Check certificate installation
ls -la /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/

# Test HTTPS connectivity
curl -v https://github.com

# Reinstall certificates
~/.devcontainer-scripts/install-certificates.sh
```

#### Environment Setup Problems
```bash
# Re-run full setup
~/.devcontainer-scripts/setup-environment.sh

# Validate environment
~/.devcontainer-scripts/validate-environment.sh
```

## Migration Between Approaches

### From Devenv to Devcontainer
1. Identify the specific issue with devenv (SSH, certificates, etc.)
2. Open project in VS Code
3. Choose "Reopen in Container" when prompted
4. Wait for automatic setup to complete
5. Validate with `~/.devcontainer-scripts/validate-environment.sh`

### From Devcontainer to Devenv
1. Ensure host SSH agent and certificates are working
2. Close container in VS Code
3. Reopen in WSL (choose "Reopen in WSL")
4. Allow direnv to activate devenv environment
5. Test functionality with devenv commands

## Integration with Repository

### Configuration Alignment
- **Development Tools**: Matches `devenv.nix` package selection
- **Certificate Handling**: Uses `system/certificates.nix` patterns
- **Shell Configuration**: Consistent fish + starship setup
- **Windows Integration**: Leverages `home/windows/` modules

### Validation Consistency
- **Testing Framework**: Uses Nix-based validation like repository patterns
- **Environment Variables**: Mirrors system certificate environment setup
- **SSH Configuration**: Aligns with repository SSH patterns
- **Git Configuration**: Uses same safe directory and user settings
