### Architecture Summary

```
Devcontainer Stack
├── Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (latest stable base)
├── Multi-stage Dockerfile (optimized build)
├── Nix Package Manager (single-user with flakes)
├── Certificate Management (multi-source detection)
├── SSH Integration (VS Code native + fallbacks)
├── Fish Shell + Starship (matching repository)
├── Development Tools (aligned with devenv.nix)
└── Comprehensive Testing (Nix-based validation)
```

## Key Technical Innovations

### 1. Multi-Source Certificate Detection
```bash
Certificate Sources (Priority Order):
1. Container Direct: /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/corporate/
2. Repository: /workspaces/nix-config-wsl/certs/zscaler.pem
3. Windows User: /mnt/c/Users/*/AppData/Local/Zscaler/
4. Windows System: /mnt/c/ProgramData/Zscaler/cert/
```

### 2. Robust SSH Integration
```json
Primary: VS Code native SSH agent forwarding
Fallback 1: SSH key mounting with proper permissions
Fallback 2: SSH key synchronization using repository patterns
Emergency: Manual SSH key configuration
```

### 3. Comprehensive Validation Framework
```bash
Testing Layers:
- System health checks (Docker health check)
- Nix environment validation
- Development tool functionality
- SSH connectivity testing
- Certificate chain verification
- Network connectivity validation
- Application testing via nix-shell
```

## Integration Achievements

### Repository Pattern Alignment
- **Certificate Handling**: Mirrors `system/certificates.nix` validation and environment setup
- **Development Tools**: Matches `devenv.nix` package selection and configuration
- **Shell Configuration**: Consistent fish shell and starship prompt setup
- **Git Configuration**: Aligned with repository Git settings and safe directories

### Windows-WSL Manager Integration
- **Environment Variables**: Promotes Windows environment variables using existing patterns
- **Certificate Store Access**: Accesses Windows certificates via WSL mounts
- **SSH Key Sharing**: Integrates with existing SSH synchronization scripts
- **VS Code Settings**: Coordinates with repository VS Code configuration

## Performance Characteristics

### Resource Usage
- **Memory**: ~500MB (vs ~50MB for devenv)
- **Disk**: ~2GB per container (vs shared Nix store for devenv)
- **Startup**: 2-5 minutes cold, 30-60s warm (vs 5-15s for devenv)
- **File I/O**: ~90% of native performance

### Optimization Features
- Multi-stage Dockerfile for faster builds
- Health checks for container readiness monitoring
- Optimized Nix configuration with auto-optimization
- Efficient certificate caching and validation

## Corporate Environment Features

### Zscaler Support
- Automatic certificate detection from multiple sources
- Certificate validation with comprehensive error handling
- Environment variable setup for all certificate-dependent tools
- HTTPS connectivity testing and validation

### Proxy Compatibility
- Proxy-friendly Nix configuration
- Certificate-aware package installation
- Network connectivity validation
- Fallback approaches for restricted environments

## Validation and Testing

### Comprehensive Test Suite
- **System Tests**: Basic system functionality and permissions
- **Nix Tests**: Package manager functionality and flake support
- **Tool Tests**: Development tool availability and functionality
- **SSH Tests**: Agent forwarding and connectivity validation
- **Certificate Tests**: Certificate installation and HTTPS connectivity

## Usage Scenarios

### Primary Use Cases
1. **SSH Agent Issues**: When VS Code WSL SSH forwarding is problematic
2. **Certificate Problems**: Corporate environments with complex certificate requirements
3. **Team Consistency**: Need for identical development environments
4. **CI/CD Integration**: Container-based development workflows
5. **Environment Isolation**: Complete separation from host system required

### Migration Paths
- **From Devenv**: Seamless transition when devenv encounters issues
- **To Devenv**: Easy migration back when host environment is stable
- **Hybrid Usage**: Team members can use different approaches based on their environment

## Maintenance and Updates
